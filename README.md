Cryptodex is an app that can scan cryptocurrency qr codes from coinbase and extract the wallet address. This app is purposely limited in functionality and is used as a back-up reference and prototype demonstration to build-out a more complete commercial application in the future.

This repository contains the prototype XCode project files.
